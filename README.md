This repository contains three machine learning projects. I completed these as part of my DataScience internship with MyDailyWork.

Project 1: Movie Rating Prediction

The Movie Rating Project involves predicting movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors using regression techniques. The project includes data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a linear regression model to forecast ratings. The goal is to identify the most influential factors affecting movie ratings and create a model that accurately predicts ratings, providing insights for the film industry.

Project 2: Sales Prediction

The Sales Prediction Project involves developing a predictive model to forecast future sales based on historical data, seasonality, trends, and other relevant factors. Using machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, the project aims to identify patterns and relationships in sales data, enabling businesses to make informed decisions, optimize resources, and drive revenue growth. By analyzing past sales data, the model predicts future sales, providing valuable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business planning.

Project 3: Titanic Survival Prediction

The Titanic Survival Prediction Project involves building a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of survival for passengers on the ill-fated ship based on characteristics such as age, gender, class, and embarkation point. Using machine learning algorithms and historical data from the tragedy, the project aims to identify key factors influencing survival rates, providing insights into the disaster's demographics and circumstances. By analyzing passenger attributes, the model predicts survival outcomes, offering a data-driven perspective on this historic event.

Technologies Used

The three projects - Movie Rating Prediction, Sales Prediction, and Titanic Survival Prediction - utilize similar technologies, including:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Joblib. These tools enable data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and model saving, forming a robust foundation for predictive modeling and data science tasks.
